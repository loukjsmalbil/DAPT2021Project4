# Project: Descriptive Statistics and Inferential Statistics

## Overview
The goal of this project is to practice all the skills you've learnt so far. The focus of this project in particular is on statistics. 


## Technical Requirements

The technical requirements for this project are as follows:

- Come up with an interesting research question and find data to answer your question. Having a research question or set of questions is particularly important for this project! 
- Create a Jupyter notebook or Python file to analyze the data.
 - Create at least two confidence intervals, two one-sample hypothesis tests (z-test and/or t-test), two two-sample hypothesis tests (z-test and/or t-test). 
 - Feel free to use matplotlib, seaborn, or plotly as you see fit to best convey
   the message and the story behind the data.

## Presentation Guideline and Criteria

### Format

* Presentation Time: 15 minutes max.
* Q & A: 5 minutes.
* **Total Time:** 20 minutes.

### Outputs

* Present a slideshow in which you present your findings. Make sure this slide show is structured. You may use a Jupyter notebook slideshow similar to the one used in the lectures, but this is not mandatory.  
* Explain your research question(s), thought process and learnings. 
* Explain *how* the visuals help you explain your questions. 
* Explain *how* the statistics help you explain your questions. Do not simply mention the outcome values of your tests. 

## Necessary Deliverables

* **Project repository** 
* Your repository must be clean and organized; this means that it must include a **.gitignore**  file that blocks any images and datafiles, a **README file** and also have a functional file structure. As template you could use the repository you created  for project2
* **An empty data folder** with a readme file inside that explains the data set
* Your README file must clearly include which topic you chose and which are the questions you would like to find an answer to.
* **Please add the repository link on the excel sheet on our g. drive [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Q5Ao2rJbzb4KVvby3foPwla-CGxipLWr)**

* **Python files Jupyter notebooks**
These files should be self sufficient. Someone with no exposure to the problem should be able to read the notebooks and understand your analysis. Make sure your notebooks look clean and well documented by making proper use of comments, docstrings and markdowns. We strongly suggest to start the notebook with and Introduction and conclude it with a Conclusions section. 

The following deliverables should **NOT** be pushed to your group's repository
but stored on your group folder [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zIDpffMj5iQ5xKKGV3nSKM38buvRM6jp?usp=sharing) 

- **A presentation deck (slides)** containing your analysis and your visualisations.
- **DATA** Please upload any data to the repository.
 
## Useful questions to ask yourself

* __Technical Requirements__: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

* __Creativity__: Did you add a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you incorporate domain knowledge or unique perspective into your analysis

* __Code Quality__: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class?

This will be useful as an overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but __the more important scores are described in the specs above__, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!
